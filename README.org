* About

coup is a simple program for managing library dependencies in Haskell cabal
projects and building your cabal packages.  It lets you specify an exact list of
Haskell library versions that the project is allowed to use, and maintains a
local ghc database and cabal settings for that list.

Some features:
- works relatively seamlessly around cabal.
- projects are uniquely identified by the package list provided by the user.
  - only packages from the project's package list may be installed.
  - any number of versions of a project may exist, each one with its own package
    list.
- separate ghc database and settings for each project.
- shared package cache between all projects, to avoid downloading duplicate
  tarballs.
- identical installed libraries are shared between projects.

coup requires a patched version of Cabal and cabal-install, available as
submodules in the coup repository.
